Happy Happy Hour is just like a normal happy hour, but with the added benefit of reducing food waste from local businesses! Businesses can post a date, time, location, and deal for what would normally go to waste (ex. not-as-fresh bagels are 50% off), and users can enjoy saving money and the planet.
